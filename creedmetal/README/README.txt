Script has been primarily build  for Ox_Lib and Ox_Inventory

When Importing the script you must add all items which are in item.txt into Ox_Inventory's item and ensure there are
no duplicate items

ox_inventory/data/items.lua

luckily Creed Scripts has providied every time to add into the items.lua which can be found in 'items' txt

Fortunently we have also provided icons for each item in our script readme/icons which you can drag and drop each image-
into ox_inventory/web/images.
